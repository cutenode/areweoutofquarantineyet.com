## Contributing

This repo has a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Follow it.

Contributions to enhance the repository are more than welcome. I can't guarantee how responsive I'll be to PRs since I have a pretty overwhelming inbox of PRs on projects, but if you don't hear back from me on something feel free to [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitandbang) – I'll almost certainly respond to that and take some time to review your PR.

If you want to contribute anything that would invalidate the name – No Boilerplate – please reconsider and don't spend your time on something that probably won't be merged.
